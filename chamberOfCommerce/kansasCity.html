        <h3>Historical Information:</h3>
        <h4>City Origins</h4>
        <p>
          The origins of Kansas City date to the early 1800s, when French fur
          traders arrived by the Missouri River and built rough cabins along the
          river. The town of Kansas was formed in 1838 and a trail connecting
          the river landing to the Santa Fe Trail in the town of Westport was
          established. Several years later commercial buildings were popping up
          along the river bluffs. The era leading up to the Civil War was a
          tense and bloody time in Kansas City, as Missouri was a slave state
          and Kansas a free state. The Battle of Westport–one of bloodiest
          battles west of the Mississippi–took place in what today is Loose Park
          and Forest Hill Cemetery. With the Union prevailing, the city remained
          divided. Northerners preferred to live on the west side of Main Street
          on streets dubbed Pennsylvania, Broadway and Washington, and
          Southerners on the east side on streets such as Oak, Walnut and
          Locust. By 1870 a downtown street grid had been established.
        </p>
        <h4>Building Boom</h4>
        <p>
          In 1906 gave rise to several modern skyscrapers, including the R.A.
          Long building at 10th and Grand, the Scarritt Building at 8th and
          Grand, and Commerce Bank at 10th and Walnut. In 1907 electricity was
          celebrated with the opening of a grand amusement park called Electric
          Park at 47th and Paseo. In 1909 the City expanded as far south as 77th
          Street, resulting in many new houses, businesses, roads and
          boulevards. That same year the Kansas City Zoo opened in Swope Park
          and the Boley Building designed by Louis Curtiss featured the first
          “curtain wall” design. With more room to stretch out, many working
          class citizens moved to residential neighborhoods primarily consisting
          of bungalows and simple four square houses that were accessible by the
          cable car. For more wealthy residents, J.C. Nichols built the County
          Club District in the area south of Brush Creek, and was planning
          shopping centers to serve these midtown residential neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <h4>Jazz, Baseball, and Corruption</h4>
        <p>
          In the 1930s, jazz reached its artistic and popular peak, with Kansas
          City at the center of the action. Nightclubs opened along 12th Street
          and at 18th and Vine, and become popular venues where many notable and
          innovative musicians gathered. The segregated 18th and Vine area, in
          particular, was a place where jazz and baseball came together. Blues
          Stadium for the Negro National League, the Mutual Musicians Foundation
          and popular joints such as the Blue Room at the Streets were all
          located within 1/2 mile.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Depression, while most other cities were suffering, “Tom’s
          Town” expanded. Mayor Tom Pendergast’s 10 Year Plan funded some
          significant construction projects that kept the City’s economy afloat,
          including a number of great examples of Art Deco design: the 29 story
          City Hall, the former Jackson County Courthouse, Fidelity Bank and
          Trust and Municipal Auditorium. Taxes were half the amount of
          comparable cities, and the City Manager at the time admitted to a
          sleight of hand when handling the bills related to these projects.
          Corruption was widespread and Kansas City was noted for its vices
          under Mayor Pendergast’s term.
        </p>
        <h4>Modern Times</h4>
        <p>
          In the past 20 years the city has made much progress locating
          businesses and residents downtown, which has contributed to
          revitalization. Today, areas such as Crossroads Arts District and City
          Market are popular and trendy. In the past 10 years Kansas City has
          made strides in positioning itself as a great place to live and work.
          Construction of the Power and Light District and the Sprint Center in
          the heart of downtown has done much to encourage commerce and
          revitalization in the urban core. The city has also received world
          recognition for several projects, including the Bloch addition to the
          Nelson Atkins Museum of Art and the Kauffman Center for the Performing
          Arts, both of which are award winning and notable designs.
